Future Targets
==============

We have some other things that we are planning for Judgels but is still in our minds and this document:

- Training Gate System

  A interactive training gate where anyone can learn about programming. The current training gate at `tokilearning.org <http://tokilearning.org>`_ is still not friendly anough for anyone to start learning programming.

- Online Course System

  A system for academic purpose at academic institution (school, institute, university, etc). Through this system, institution can manage students by online means (like moodle). The key difference is this system support programming grading (auto grading).

- Control Panel

  Currently, Judgels system is still lack of user friendly way to control, manage and monitor running Judgels applications. Yeah, we need this.

- Forum

  We want to create forum which is integrated to Judgels where user can discuss and share anything related to Judgels. The forum can't use existing one because we need it to be integrated to Judgels.

- Drive

  Imagine when all of your source codes and your submissions is saved and tracked in online file manager. Well, that is the Drive for you.

- Editor

  The editor that can be used and integrated with Judgels system. The editor is like IDEOne, etc.
