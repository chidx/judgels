Team-based contests
-------------------

It is possible to conduct a team-based contest in Uriel. Teams can be assigned in the **Teams** subtab in **Contestants** tab. Team-based contests work best for virtual contests. The use case is similar to APIO (Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad):

- A contestant is assigned to a team.
- In a team, there are coaches.
- The coaches start the contests for their contestants (in virtual contests).
- The coaches can view the scoreboard for their contestants.
