Roles
=====

New contests can only be created by admins.

For each contest, there are three roles:

Managers
    Managers of a contest are assigned by admins. Managers can:

    - Update contest configurations.
    - Assign supervisors.
    - Do everything a supervisor can.

Supervisors
    Supervisors of a contest are assigned by managers (or admins). Supervisors can perform some aspects in a contest based on the list of permissions assigned to them. For example: supervising announcements, clarifications, etc.

Contestants
    Can do contests.
