Repository Gate
===============

Repository Gate is a place for storing resources used by other Judgels applications. There are two kinds of resources: **problems** and **lessons**. A problem is an HTML document that shows question to be solved by *submitting* a solution to it. A lesson is an HTML document that shows learning materials only.

A typical workflow for you as a Repository Gate's operator is as follows:

- You create new problems/lessons. For problems, you will also have to specify some configurations. For example, for programming problems, you have to configure test cases.
- You (or another operator) **share** them to Repository Gate's **clients**, such as Competition Gate or Training Gate. The administrator should have set up the clients.
- You (or another operator) add the shared problems/lessons in a contest (in Competition Gate) or course/session (in Training Gate).

You will learn more about lessons and problems, common features in problems and lessons, and how to share resources to the clients in the next sections.
