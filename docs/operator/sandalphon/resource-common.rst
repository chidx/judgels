Common resources features
=========================

In this section, you will learn about common features that are present in both lessons and problems.

Managing statements
-------------------

Writing title and text
**********************

Don't forget to specify resource title, since you only specified the slug when you created the resource.

For writing the resource text, you are provided with a WYSIWYG editor.

Inserting images
****************

You can insert images to the statement. Upload the image as media file in the **Media** subtab, and then insert it to the statement by adding an image with this URL: **render/<imageFilename>**.

Adding other languages
**********************

You can have multiple versions of the statements, based on language. You can add new languages in the **Languages** subtab. **Default language** is the default language shown to the user. You can also disable a language. When viewing the statement, users can switch language to their preferences

Managing partners
-----------------

You can share the privilege to modify the resource you created to other users (called **partners**). Add the username of the user you want to share, in the **Partners** subtab. You can specify the permissions you want to grant.

Managing versions
-----------------

Every changes to a resource will be tracked in a version control. Every time you consider that you have finished making a change, you have to **commit** your change so that the changes take effect. When you commit, one of the following events will happen:

- The commit succeeded. Your changes will be recorded.
- New commits have been made since you started editing. You will be prompted to update your local working copy. Click **Update Working Copy**. One of the following events will happen:

  - Update working copy succeeded. You can continue committing.
  - Update working copy failed. Your changes conflicts with the previous commits. Currently, there is no solution. You have to remember/save your changes somewhere and then click **Discard Local Changes** to discard your changes and load the latest version.

Note that you can also update working copy or discard local changes any time during your modification.
