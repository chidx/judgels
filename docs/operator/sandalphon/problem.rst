Managing problems
=================

In this section, you will learn how to write a problem and configure it.

Problem types
-------------

There are two types of problems that are supported in Repository Gate: **programming** problems and **bundle** problems.

A programming problem is a typical competitive programming problem which has a set of test cases used for grading contestant's solution.

A bundle problem is a non-programming problem each containing several items. Currently, an item can only be a simple statement or a multiple-choice question.
