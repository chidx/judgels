Managing resources
==================

Resource types
--------------

There are two types of resources that are supported by Sandalphon: problems and lessons. The resources can be used by **Sandalphon clients**, for example, Uriel and Jerahmeel.

Sharing resources to Sandalphon clients
---------------------------------------

If a Sandalphon client wants to use a resource from Sandalphon, perform these steps.

#. Enter the corresponding resource (problem/lesson).
#. Click the **Clients** tab.
#. Choose the client, and then click **Create New**.
#. View the client. You will see the resource JID and resource secret, for that particular client.

The client can then fetch the resource from Sandalphon, using the provided resource JID and resource secret.
