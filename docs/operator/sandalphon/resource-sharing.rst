Sharing resources to clients
============================

If a Repository Gate's client wants to use a resource, perform these steps.

#. Enter the corresponding resource (problem/lesson).
#. Click the **Clients** tab.
#. Choose the client, and then click **Create New**.
#. View the client. You will see the resource JID and resource secret, for that particular client. Using that pair of JID and secret, you can add the resource to contests/sessions/etc.
