Only managers can remove contestants.

Methods for adding people
-------------------------

People with any role can be added using two interfaces: manually adding persons one-by-one, and adding multiple persons at once using a text file.

If you want to use the latter method, you can upload a plain text file containing newline-separated usernames of the people you want to add.
