Managing contest teams
======================

A team-based contest can be conducted in Competition Gate. To enable team-based contest, enable **Team** module. Teams can be assigned in the **Teams** tab.

A team consists of

- Team name
- Team logo (optional)
- One or more coaches
- One or more members as the contestants

A team-based is more or less similar to usual a contest. The only major difference is that coaches:

- Can see the scoreboard entries for their contestants.
- Can translate clarifications from their contestants.
- In virtual contests, coaches can start the contest for their contestants.

It is possible that a contestant does not get assigned to a team. A contestant can be assigned to at most one team. A user, however, can be a coach of multiple teams.
