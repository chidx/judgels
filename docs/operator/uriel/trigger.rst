Managing contest triggers
=========================

For a contest that is both virtual and team-based, you can specify that only coaches can start the contest for their own contestants. An example that needs this feature is Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO) contests.

Simply enable **Trigger** module, then select **Coach** in the configuration.

The coaches can then start the contest via **Teams** tab. They can click the start button to start the contest. Once the contest has started, it can't be undone.
