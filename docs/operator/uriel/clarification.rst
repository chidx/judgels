Managing contest clarifications
===============================

To enable clarifications in the contest, enable the **Clarification** module.

If you want that clarifications can only be made for a specified duration after the contest begins, enable the **Clarification Time Limit** module. You can then specify the duration since the contest begins.

Clarifications behave differently for contestants, supervisors, and coaches.

For contestants
    Contestants can make clarifications during the contest or during the clarification time window. They can specify the problem they want to clarify, or just general clarification.

For coaches
    In a team-based contest, coaches can translate the clarifications made by their contestants.

For supervisors
    Supervisors can answer contestants' clarifications.
