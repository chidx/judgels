Managing contest scoreboards
============================

To enable scoreboard in the contest, enable the **Scoreboard** module. In the module configuration, you can set that the scoreboard will be **incognito**, i.e. contestants can only see their own scores in the scoreboard. Supervisors can always see full scoreboard.

If you want that the scoreboard can be frozen, enable the **Frozen Scoreboard** module. Frozen scoreboard can only be used in contests that are non-virtual and have fixed times. In the module configuration, you can set the freeze time that is specified as duration before the contest ends. After that, you can unfreeze the scoreboard by selecting the **official scoreboard allowed** from the module configuration.
