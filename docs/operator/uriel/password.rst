Managing contest passwords
==========================

A contest can be given a password that the contestants must type before they can enter the contest. This is useful for onsite contests, so that contestants cannot cheat by sharing their Single Sign-On passwords. Enable the **Password** module to activate this feature.

You can generate the passwords in the **Password** tab. The password for each contestant will be different from each other. You can re-generate all passwords or individual passwords.
