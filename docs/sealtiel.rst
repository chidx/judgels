Sealtiel (Message Gate)
=======================

Sealtiel is the bridge that handles asynchronous messages between Judgels applications. Currently it is only used for delivering grading requests and responses between Gabriel and the other Judgels applications.

Internally, Sealtiel uses `RabbitMQ <http://rabbitmq.com>`_.
